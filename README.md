#A Neural Link to the Past

This works trough a Multi-Layer Perceptron, given a defined machine state as target in order to train. During runtime only the feedforward function is used.
Can be trained to other machine states and a hash could be added for added randomness.

#Dungeon Generator

Automated Zelda-style dungeon generation, able to pick a completely randomized or a optimally linear dungeon from either spacial constraints or constraints that only limit the number of rooms.
